# Views DSL IDE preview \[DEPRECATED\]

*Preview UIs made with Splitties Views DSL.*

This [split](../../README.md#what-is-a-split "What is a split in Splitties?")
has been **deprecated** and is now included directly into the debug variant of the
[Views DSL](../views-dsl/README.md#ide-preview) split. The package name has been left unchanged.

## Dependency (for reference)

```groovy
debugImplementation("com.louiscad.splitties:splitties-views-dsl-ide-preview:$splitties_version")
```
