== Run migrateToAndroidX

=== Why?

Theoretically, migrating a project to AndroidX is easy: you just select the menu `Refactor > Migrate to AndroidX` from the "Refactor" menu.

Unfortunately, in addition to being unacceptably slow, it didn't work properly for Splitties (except for a past attempt which had to be abandoned for API stability reasons).

Our experience was waiting minutes with an unresponsive IDE, then giving up with no other choice than force closing Android Studio,
and finally getting a broken project, with some dangling fully qualified references (instead of proper import replacement).
We reverted and looked for an alternative that would work properly, and perform faster.

Using the CSV export of the https://developer.android.com/jetpack/androidx/migrate/artifact-mappings[artifact mappings] and https://developer.android.com/jetpack/androidx/migrate/class-mappings:[class mappings],
we implemented a basic search and replace in Kotlin that runs in a matter of seconds.

You can use it for your project too, so you can migrate to AndroidX quickly, and in a fun way.

=== How?

```bash
$ ./gradlew migrateToAndroidX`
There's 24 source files that may need migration
CSV file ok.

7 source files (kt,java,xml) have been migrated (17 didn't need it).
1 gradle files have been migrated (0 didn't need it).
AndroidX migration complete!
You now just need to update the dependencies, if not already done.

```

Note that this script doesn't migrate the dependencies, because it would have been harder to handle all the edge cases. Feel free to submit a pull-request.
